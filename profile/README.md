# Balder App

Balder App is a special App that is cloned to produce new apps, using the forks system of Git Hub.
Our backend server is common for all the apps and is important to keep the back-track compatibility.

## Rules
- The backend needs to be back-compatible

- We develop on the Costumer Fork

- If some functionality is generic, we merge from the fork to the mobile app 

- If we are updating the app to the latest version, we sync the fork with the app

- Each Fork has its own board.

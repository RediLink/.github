# Balder App

Balder App is a special App which is clone to produce new apps, using the forks system of github.
Our backend server is common for all the apps and is important to keep the back-track compatibility.

## Rules
- Backend need to be back compatible

- We develop on the Costumer Fork

- If some functionality is generic, we merge from the fork to mobile app 

- If we are updating the app to the latest version, we sync the fork with the app

- Each Fork has his own board.
